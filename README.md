# X_DAO
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for proposal management and voting using token staking.
Overview:
X_DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization
(DAO) implemented on the Ethereum platform using
smart contracts written in Solidity. This project
exemplifies how blockchain technology can be
utilized to create decentralized communities where
participants have equal opportunities to propose,
discuss, and vote on decisions that influence the
organization's development.

Project Objectives:
The primary goal of X_DAO is to create a
decentralized platform that allows users to participate
in the governance of the organization, contribute
through proposals, vote on these proposals, and
receive rewards for active participation via a staking
mechanism. This project is part of my portfolio and
aims to demonstrate my skills in developing smart
contracts and understanding the principles of
decentralized systems.

Key Functionalities:
Proposal Creation (propose): Any participant holding
a sufficient amount of tokens can submit a proposal.
Proposals can relate to any aspect of organizational
management, from policy changes to resource
allocation.

Voting on Proposals (vote): Participants can vote for
or against proposals using their tokens. Each token
provides one vote, encouraging participants to take
an active role in governance.

Proposal Execution (executeProposal): Proposals
that receive the necessary number of 'yes' votes can
be executed. This process completes the voting
procedure and implements the proposed changes.
Token Staking (stakeTokens): Participants can lock
their tokens to obtain voting rights. Staking increases
a participant's voting power, providing them with
greater influence in the decision-making process.
Locking Period for Tokens: Staked tokens are locked
for a predefined period (e.g., 7 days), during which
they cannot be withdrawn, but the participant retains
voting rights based on their stake.

Reward Distribution: Participants who actively
engage in voting and staking receive rewards. These
rewards are distributed proportionally to their
contributions to the DAO, fostering active
participation and loyalty.

Technical Details:
X_DAO is developed using the following
technologies:
Solidity: The programming language used for writing
smart contracts on Ethereum.

Remix IDE: An integrated development environment
for writing, compiling, and deploying smart contracts.
MetaMask: A cryptocurrency wallet and browser
plugin that allows direct interaction with blockchainbased applications.

Deployment and Usage Instructions:
Cloning the Repository: Use the command git clone
to clone the repository from GitHub. Navigate to the
directory where the project is stored.

Compiling the Smart Contract: Open the project in
Remix IDE. Ensure you are using the correct version
of the Solidity compiler (e.g., 0.8.x). Compile the
contract by clicking on "Compile".

Deploying the Contract: Connect your MetaMask
wallet to Remix using "Injected Provider - MetaMask".
Select a test network like Rinkeby for deployment.
Deploy the contract and confirm the transaction in
MetaMask.

Interacting with the Contract: Once deployed, the
contract functions can be accessed in the "Deployed
Contracts" tab in Remix. Participants can propose,
vote, execute proposals, stake tokens, and withdraw
them following the completion of the locking period.
